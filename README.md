# Data-Science-Celebal Week-1

Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.

# Data-Science-Celebal Week-2

Create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Your implementation should include the following: A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test your implementation with at least one sample list.

Take Any dataset of your choice and do the visualization

# Data-Science-Celebal Week-4

Conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on a complex dataset. Focus on understanding data distributions, identifying missing values, detecting outliers, and uncovering relationships between variables. Utilize visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to support your findings.

# Data-Science-Celebal Week-6

Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters. Analyze the results to select the best-performing model.
